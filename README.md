This repo contains my LIRC and Irplus configs. Better late, than never.

## LG [LX-M245](https://www.google.com/search?q=LG+LX-M245&tbm=isch)

Micro Hi-Fi stereo by LG. Discontinued. Manufactured in 2005-01-20. Infrared remote label "6710CMAP01A".

Reason of interest - remote uses same codes as all members of remote family "6710CMA" (0x808), so it can control multiple micro Hi-Fi systems.

Also I reverse-engineered protocol, so you can try every button from 256 keyspace.


## [Витязь](http://www.vityas.com) [37CTV-6622-M](https://www.google.com/search?q=37CTV-6622-M&tbm=isch)

And old TV "37CTV-6622-M" by Витязь. Discontinued. Infrared remote label "RC-5".

Reason of interest - it can control wall-mounted [Integral](https://integral.by) clocks (Интеграл ЧЕН-08, ЧЭ-03). Read the manual first: setup isn't straightforward, manual in Russian, and worst of all - it can sing loudly!

This repo contains my LIRC and Irplus configs. Better late, than never.


## LG LX-M245 (micro Hi-Fi stereo)

Note, that "6710CMAP01A" uses same codes as all members of remote family "6710CMA" (0x808), so it can control multiple micro Hi-Fi systems.

Also I reverse-engineered protocol, so you can try every button from 256 keyspace.

* TV Телевизор Витязь 37CTV-6622-M
* Wall-mounted [Integral](https://integral.by) clocks (Интеграл ЧЕН-08, ЧЭ-03). Read the manual first: setup isn't straightforward, manual in Russian, and worst of all - it can sing loudly!
